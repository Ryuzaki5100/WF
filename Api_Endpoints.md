# API Endpoints Documentation

## Introduction
This document provides detailed information about the API endpoints available in the backend system.

## Base URLs
- Client Server Base URL: `http://localhost:5000`
- Exchange Server Base URL: `http://localhost:5001`

## API Type
- API Type: RESTful

## Authentication
The backend system utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. JWT tokens are generated based on the `wallet_id` and `loginTime` of the user and are stored on the user's side as cookies.

### JWT Token Generation

- **Token Generation Process:**
  - JWT tokens are generated by combining the `wallet_id` and `loginTime` of the user.
  - The combination of these values is signed using a secure algorithm to create a unique token for the user's session.

### Cookie Storage

- **Cookie Handling:**
  - Once the JWT token is generated, it is stored as a cookie on the user's side.
  - The cookie contains the JWT token, which is used for subsequent authentication and authorization requests to the backend system.
  - The token expiry is set based on the cookie expiry time.

### Token Expiry and Renewal

- **Token Expiry:**
  - The JWT token expiry is synchronized with the cookie expiry time.
  - When the token reaches its expiry time, it will be automatically cleared from the user's browser.
  - Users may need to re-authenticate to obtain a new token after the previous token expires.

### Payload Format in JSON

- **JWT Token Payload:**
  - The payload of the JWT token is encoded in JSON format and includes information such as:

    ```json
    {
      "wallet_id": "user_wallet_id",
      "loginTime": "timestamp"
    }
    ```
  - The payload contains essential information such as the `wallet_id` and `loginTime` to generate tokens and authorize user sessions.


By using JWT tokens generated from the `wallet_id` and `loginTime` of the user and storing them as cookies with synchronized expiry times, the backend system ensures secure authentication and authorization for user sessions.

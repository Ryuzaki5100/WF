1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for the backend architecture of an automated trading system. This system will simulate exchange interactions by having client servers subscribe to exchange data, handle real-time data via web sockets, manage user credentials and transactions, and execute trading algorithms based on cached trade information.

1.2 Scope
This SRS covers the backend system designed to facilitate automated trading by simulating exchange data subscriptions, handling real-time data, managing user credentials and transaction records, leveraging a Redis cache for real-time trade information, and executing trading decisions via an algorithmic bot.

1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
API: Application Programming Interface
Redis: Remote Dictionary Server
WebSocket: A communication protocol for full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection
SRS: Software Requirements Specification
Bot: An automated trading algorithm
DB: Database

1.5 Overview
This document is structured to describe the overall architecture, system features, external interfaces, and non-functional requirements of the backend system. It will also cover detailed descriptions of each system feature and their respective requirements.

2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective
The product is an automated trading backend system. It simulates exchange data subscriptions via client servers, handles real-time data, manages user credentials and transaction records, and makes trading decisions based on cached trade information.

2.2 Product Functions

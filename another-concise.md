# Internship Report: Backend Development for Cryptocurrency Arbitrage

## Introduction

During my internship, I worked on a cryptocurrency arbitrage project. The goal was to design and implement a backend system that could handle real-time data for different cryptocurrencies across multiple exchanges, facilitating seamless and secure transactions while implementing an effective arbitrage algorithm. This report outlines my contributions, the challenges faced, and how they were overcome.

## Project Overview

The backend system had two main servers: a client server and an exchange server. The exchange server simulated real-time changes in exchange rates, while the client server handled user interactions and displayed real-time transaction results. Communication between servers and users was managed using socket connections. Key components included cache management, secure user authentication, and transaction processing.

## Contributions

### **1. Architecting the Cache Framework and Applying OOP Principles**

- **Objective**: Develop a modular and efficient system for managing real-time data.
- **Challenges**: Ensuring scalability and performance.
- **Implementation**: Designed a cache framework using OOP principles, developed modular classes, and implemented efficient data retrieval methods.

### **2. Implementing Periodic Cache Updates via Socket Communications**

- **Objective**: Ensure the cache reflects the latest exchange values.
- **Challenges**: Synchronization and minimizing latency.
- **Implementation**: Updated the cache every 10 seconds using socket connections, ensuring non-blocking operations for efficiency.

### **3. Configuring Socket Event Handling for Seamless Data Transmission**

- **Objective**: Enable real-time communication between servers and clients.
- **Challenges**: Handling high-frequency data transmission.
- **Implementation**: Set up socket events for operations, implemented reliable event listeners and handlers, and utilized buffering techniques.

### **4. Developing Middleware and JWT-Based Authentication Mechanisms**

- **Objective**: Secure user access and authorization.
- **Challenges**: Ensuring security and performance.
- **Implementation**: Created middleware for authentication, used JWT for secure token issuance and verification, and implemented robust token checks.

### **5. Administering User Sessions with Time-to-Live Constraints**

- **Objective**: Maintain user sessions effectively.
- **Challenges**: Managing session expirations and preventing hijacking.
- **Implementation**: Incorporated a 20-minute TTL for sessions, refreshed TTL on activity, and addressed edge cases with additional checks.

### **6. Enhancing Credential Security with Encryption Techniques**

- **Objective**: Protect user credentials.
- **Challenges**: Ensuring secure encryption and decryption.
- **Implementation**: Encrypted passwords on the frontend with a public key, used a private key for backend decryption, and secured first-time credential exchanges.

### **7. Implementing a Transaction Queue System for Efficient Processing**

- **Objective**: Ensure transactions are processed with the latest data.
- **Challenges**: Managing transaction order and timing.
- **Implementation**: Developed a transaction queue, ensured processing with the latest cache data, and provided users with status updates.

## Conclusion

I leveraged my backend development skills to create a robust system for cryptocurrency arbitrage, focusing on modularity, real-time data handling, secure authentication, and transaction management. This experience deepened my understanding of backend systems and equipped me with valuable skills for future projects.

### Internship Report: Backend Development for Cryptocurrency Arbitrage

#### Introduction
During my internship, I worked on a cryptocurrency arbitrage project, designing and implementing a backend system for real-time data management and secure transactions.

#### Project Overview
The project consisted of two main servers: a client server for user interactions and a simulated exchange server for real-time exchange rates. Socket connections managed communication between servers and users' browsers.

#### Contributions

1. *Cache Framework and OOP Principles*
   - Designed a modular cache framework using OOP principles, with separate classes for entities and methods for data access/updates.
   - Implemented encapsulation, modularity, and code reusability in the cache framework.
2. *Periodic Cache Updates via Socket Communications*
   - Implemented a 10-second cache update mechanism using socket connections for real-time exchange value updates.
   - Ensured the cache consistently reflects the latest exchange values for efficient data management.
3. *Socket Event Handling for Seamless Data Transmission*
   - Configured socket events for various operations, such as fetching exchange values, executing transactions, and updating user interfaces.
   - Implemented event listeners and handlers to manage these socket events, ensuring reliable and timely data transmission.
4. *Middleware and JWT-Based Authentication Mechanisms*
   - Created middleware functions for user authentication and authorization, using JWT for secure token issuance and verification.
   - Ensured only authenticated users could access specific endpoints and perform transactions.
5. *Cache Implementation with Expiration Constraints*
   - Implemented a cache system with expiration constraints for efficient data management.
   - Ensured cache values expire within a given moment of time, addressing stale data issues.
6. *Encryption Techniques for Credential Security*
   - Added encryption for user passwords on the frontend, with secure decryption on the backend using a private key.
   - Implemented secure first-time credential exchanges, enhancing overall security.
7. *Transaction Queue System for Efficient Processing*
   - Developed a transaction queue system to manage transaction requests efficiently.
   - Ensured transactions were performed on the latest cache data and handled in the order they were received.

#### Conclusion
I contributed to building a robust and efficient backend solution for cryptocurrency arbitrage, focusing on modularity, real-time data handling, secure authentication, and transaction management.

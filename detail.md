### Internship Report: Backend Development for Cryptocurrency Arbitrage

#### Introduction
During my internship, I had the opportunity to work on a cryptocurrency arbitrage project. The project involved designing and implementing a backend system that could efficiently handle real-time data for different cryptocurrencies across multiple exchanges. The primary goal was to facilitate seamless and secure transactions for users while implementing an effective arbitrage algorithm. This report outlines my contributions and the technical details of the backend implementation.

#### Project Overview
The backend system was designed with two main servers: a client server and an exchange server. The exchange server simulated real-time changes in exchange rates for various cryptocurrencies, while the client server handled user interactions and displayed real-time transaction results. The communication between these servers and with the users' browsers was managed using socket connections. Key components of the project included cache management, secure user authentication, and transaction processing.

#### Contributions

1. *Architecting the Cache Framework and Applying OOP Principles*
   - *Objective:* To develop a modular and efficient system for managing real-time data.
   - *Implementation:* 
     - Designed a cache framework utilizing object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.
     - Developed classes to represent different entities, ensuring modularity and code reusability.
     - Implemented methods for accessing and updating cache data, encapsulating the underlying data structures.

2. *Implementing Periodic Cache Updates via Socket Communications*
   - *Objective:* To ensure the cache consistently reflects the latest exchange values.
   - *Implementation:*
     - Established a mechanism for updating the cache at regular intervals (every 10 seconds).
     - Utilized socket connections to transmit updated exchange values from the exchange server to the client server.
     - Ensured the cache update process was efficient and did not interfere with ongoing transactions.

3. *Configuring Socket Event Handling for Seamless Data Transmission*
   - *Objective:* To enable real-time communication between servers and clients.
   - *Implementation:*
     - Set up socket events for various operations, including fetching exchange values, executing transactions, and updating user interfaces.
     - Implemented event listeners and handlers to manage these socket events, ensuring reliable and timely data transmission.

4. *Developing Middleware and JWT-Based Authentication Mechanisms*
   - *Objective:* To secure user access and authorization.
   - *Implementation:*
     - Created middleware functions to handle user authentication and authorization.
     - Used JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to issue and verify tokens for authenticated users.
     - Ensured that only authorized users could access specific endpoints and perform transactions.

5. *Administering User Sessions with Time-to-Live Constraints*
   - *Objective:* To effectively maintain user sessions and address edge cases.
   - *Implementation:*
     - Incorporated a time-to-live (TTL) of 20 minutes for each user session stored in the cache.
     - Implemented mechanisms to refresh the TTL on user activity and handle session expiration.
     - Addressed edge cases such as simultaneous logins and session hijacking to ensure robust session management.

6. *Enhancing Credential Security with Encryption Techniques*
   - *Objective:* To protect user credentials during authentication processes.
   - *Implementation:*
     - Added a feature to encrypt user passwords on the frontend using a common public key.
     - Ensured the corresponding private key resided solely on the backend for secure decryption.
     - Implemented secure first-time credential exchanges, enhancing overall security.

7. *Implementing a Transaction Queue System for Efficient Processing*
   - *Objective:* To ensure transactions are processed using the most recent cache data.
   - *Implementation:*
     - Developed a transaction queue system to manage transaction requests efficiently.
     - Ensured transactions were performed on the latest cache data and handled in the order they were received.
     - Implemented status updates to inform users about the verification and completion of their transactions.

#### Conclusion
Throughout this project, I leveraged my skills in backend development to create a robust and efficient system for cryptocurrency arbitrage. By focusing on modularity, real-time data handling, secure authentication, and transaction management, I contributed to building a reliable and scalable backend solution. This experience has deepened my understanding of backend systems and equipped me with valuable skills for future projects.

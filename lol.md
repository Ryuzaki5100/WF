- **JWTs** were used for secure user authentication and authorization, ensuring that only verified users can access the system while providing a stateless, scalable solution.
- **WebSockets** facilitated real-time data transmission between the client and server, crucial for the timely execution of arbitrage opportunities in the volatile crypto market.
- **Caching** was implemented to store frequently accessed data temporarily, significantly reducing latency and improving the overall efficiency and responsiveness of the application.
- Together, these technologies ensured a secure, fast, and reliable trading environment.


- **JWTs (JSON Web Tokens)** were used for secure user authentication and authorization. By encoding user information in a token that is signed by the server, JWTs ensure that only verified users can access the system. This method is stateless, meaning the server does not need to store session information, which makes the system more scalable and efficient.

- **WebSockets** facilitated real-time data transmission between the client and server. Unlike traditional HTTP requests, WebSockets provide a persistent connection, allowing for continuous and instantaneous communication. This is crucial for the timely execution of arbitrage opportunities in the volatile crypto market, as it enables the system to react immediately to price changes.

- **Caching** was implemented to store frequently accessed data temporarily. By keeping a local copy of commonly used data, the system can quickly retrieve this information without having to repeatedly access the database or external APIs. This significantly reduces latency, improves response times, and enhances the overall efficiency and user experience of the application.

- Together, these technologies ensured a secure, fast, and reliable trading environment. JWTs provided robust security, WebSockets enabled real-time updates, and caching improved performance, all contributing to a seamless and effective crypto arbitrage system.

Subject: Request to Submit Detailed Summary of Contributions for Evaluation

Dear [Mentor's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to follow up on our recent discussions regarding the evaluation of my contributions to the project. I understand that my manager has informed you about the accidental deletion of the Git branch, and you have kindly agreed that there is no need to provide proof of contributions from the repository.

However, for the sake of thorough evaluation and to provide a clear understanding of my work, I would like to offer a detailed summary of all my commits and contributions in a written format. This summary will include descriptions of the tasks I completed, the features I developed, and any issues I resolved during the project.

I believe this documentation will give you a comprehensive overview of my efforts and the impact of my contributions on the project.

Please let me know if this would be acceptable to you, and if there are any specific details or formats you would prefer for this summary.

Thank you very much for your understanding and support.

Best regards,

[Your Name]

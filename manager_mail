Subject: Request to Submit Contributions Summary to Mentor

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

Even though the issue with providing proof of contributions due to the accidental deletion of the Git branch has been taken care of, I believe it would still be beneficial to submit a detailed summary of my commits and contributions to our mentor. This summary would include descriptions of the tasks I completed, the features I developed, and the issues I resolved throughout the project.

I feel that this documentation will offer a comprehensive view of my efforts and the value I added to the project, ensuring a fair and thorough evaluation.

Could you please let me know if it would be acceptable to send this summary to the mentor?

Thank you for your support and understanding.

Best regards,
